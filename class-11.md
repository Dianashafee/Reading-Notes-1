# Images :
You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site,  by using :

`height` :proparity witch Sets the height of an element

`width` :proparity witch Sets the width of an element

`max-width` :proparity witch Sets the maximum height of an element

`max-height` :proparity witch Sets the maximum height of an element

`min-width` :proparity witch Sets the maximum width of an element

`min-height` :proparity witch Sets the minimum width of an element

## background-image :

The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box, & youcan use:

`repeat` :attr to let background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isnâ€™t used).

`repeat-x` :attr to let image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).

# Video and Audio

## Video :
by using `<video>` tag you can add video to your page also:
1. `controls` :attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume
2. `width` and `height` attributes can be included

## Audio :
by using `<audio>` tag you can add video to your page also:
- `controls` :attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume
