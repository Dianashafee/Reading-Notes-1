## Fast intro :
***N***ow adays the intenet become availble for everyone, and the fastest way to connect the pepole betwin them, and propaply that opend the way for the big companys to itrdous them selves to the world by using the **Web Pages**, and sure that you may saw alot of these  pages that had the perfect shapes and the fuly colores and the cool animation that introduce services or peoples and companys...etc, well that depends on what internet you use or device that reads these pages but: 
- ## Have You ever wonderd how these pages are maded? 

well it is all started from the three esintals for the webpages: 

1. HTML 
: witch includse the tags and elemnts that browsers understand it 
2. CSS 
: witch enable you to controle the styleing and layout of the webpages 
3. Js 
: the dinamcal part of the page 

- ## Or even how it works? 

to make it simble to you, think about it as *phone call prossecc* so first of all when you type the webpage addres your computer contacts a network of servers called "Domain Name System **(DNS)** servers. These act like phone books, witch tell your computer the IP addres with the requsted domin name for the page witch your computer use it to allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested, and finaly the web server sends the page you requested back to your web browser, and all these prossecc hapen in plink time...
so lets begin with some talking about

# HTML :
its ***"Hypertext Markup Language"*** it uses to describe the documents (webpages) to your browser and rule how to show it, you can counsder it as the *bones* of the pages, it incliudes **Elements** that had charcters inside contianers called "**TAGS**" that made up of two **tags** 'opening and closing one' take un example how HTML code looks like:

## The Evolution of HTML :
first you have to konw that every HTML relesed to fit the  browsers on that time cuse not all the browsers used to render HTML even if it was updated with last version and her i will mention the most levels that HTML passed till today:

### 1. HTML 4 :
*Released 1997*, witch had presentational elements to control the appearance of pages like `<center>` or `<strike>`

### 2. XHTML1.0 :
*Released 1998*, witch the purpose of it relese was to allow people to write new markup language and it follow some new more strict rules about writing markup for example: ***the cloosing tags `</>`***, , ***All attributes required a value***, , ***Deprecated elements should no longer be used***  and it rules still until today..
And to help web pages authors move to this new syntax, three main flavors of XHTML 1.0 were created:
**1. Strict XHTML 1.0**, where authors had to follow the rules to the letter
**2. Transitional XHTML 1.0**, where authors could still use presentational elements
**3. XHTML 1.0 Frameset**, which allowed web page authors to partition a browser window into several "frames", each of of it would hold a different HTML page

### 3. HTML5 :
*Released 2000*, wich we will describe more about later...

SO Now its time to know about vast majority elments on the web by HTML5:

Starting with the famous ever:

- ### `<!DOCTYPE>` : Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a **DOCTYPE** declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using and every version was looks defernt notice the picture:

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%200b.PNG)


- ### `<meta>` : is an empty element, lives inside the `<head>` element It is not visible to users,It uses attributes to
carry the information and looks like: 

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%207c.PNG)

- ### `<dev>` : witch is basicly container for the other elments on the page or the (**father**) like what they call 

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%201b.PNG)

- ### `<span>` : its inline tag witch groubing text and elments in the same line and looks like: 

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%206c.PNG)

- ### `<header> <footer>` : witch use to know the header or footer of article or sction or page like this ex: 

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%202b.PNG)

- ### `<nav>` : witch is alway container for unorderd lists `**<ul>**` or orderd lists `**<ol>**` and looks like: 

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%203b.PNG)

- ### `<article>` : witch is container for difrent sections `**<section>**` and used like: 

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%204b.PNG)

- ### `<aside>` : it depending on whether if it is inside `<article>` OR outside it and sometimes used as **side Bars** container and be like: 

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%205b.PNG)

- ### `<section>` : witch grouping the content together EX: 

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%206b.PNG)

- ### `<hgroup>` : it used to group headers togther EX: 

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%207b.PNG)

- ### `<figure>` OR `<figcaption>` : witch used to contain any content that is referenced like photos or videos or even aoudios and looks like: 

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%208b.PNG)

- ### `<iframe>` : its most like a window to other pages or weebsites and the commoun use to is to embed a Google Map into a page, and use alot attributes like :
1) **src**
2) **height**
3) **width**
4) **scrolling** (The scrolling attribute will not be supported in HTML5. In HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates whether the iframe should have scrollbars or not. This is important if the page inside the iframe is larger than the space you have allowed for it (using the height and width attributes), Scrollbars allow the user to move around the frame to see more
content. It can take one of three values: ***yes*** (to show scrollbars), ***no*** (to hide scrollbars) and, ***auto*** (to show them only if needed))
5) **frameborder** (witch will not be supported in HTML5. In HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates whether the frame should have
a border or not, ***A value of 0*** indicates that no border should be shown. ***A value of 1*** indicates that a border should be shown)
6) **seamless** (witch is new attrbute and it can be applied to an `iframe` where scrollbars are not desired, like other HTML5 atrr seamless does not need a value)

## Escape Characters:
thay are bunch of charcters that that are used in and reserved by HTML code, *When using escape characters, it is important to check the page in your browser to ensure that the correct symbol shows up. This is because some fonts do not support all of these characters and you might therefore need to specify a different font for these characters in your CSS code
There are also special codes that can be used to show symbols such as copyright and trademark, currency symbols, 
mathematical characters, and some punctuation marks... like:

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%20D.PNG)

<br>

## Comments On HTML :
so biscly the comments used to describe what hapinig inside the code and its **unvisble** to the users, it also helps you to keep tracking your code, and let it easy to find bugs and fixed it, in HTML it looks like: `<!-- comment goes here -->` or 

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%201c.PNG) 
<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Attributes in HTML :
there is alot of **Attributes** in HTML but the important and much used in community is :

### - ID :
which every element carry one, Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character), and we use it in other program languges to call that element, and looks like :

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%202c.PNG)

<br>

### - Class:
Its value should describe the class it belongs to, you can find it in many elements and used to call bunch of elements togather and give them specific fetures or style and looks like :

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%203c.PNG)

<br>

## HTML5 and Old Browsers :
so basicly HTML5 considr as new version of HTML so its posible to find some old browsers dosent understand it so always add line to css that tells the old browsers to treat and rendered it HTML5 as rendered **block-level**elements(witch means the elements witch always appear to start on a new line in the browser window)..
**Also** many of these browsers dosent supourt JS codes!! like ***IE8***, So the designer used to add an html **conditional
comment** to ther code to cheak if the browser was IE8 or older, ***so the code link to a copy that Google hosts on its servers***
<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Elements Types:
so there is tow kinds of **elements** on HTML the :

***1. Blocked*** (witch is some elements witch always appear to start on a new line in the browser window) Like: (capture 4c)
***2. Inline*** (witch is some elements will always appear to continue on the same line) Like: 

![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%205c.PNG)

<br>
<hr>
<br>

### Example of HTML5 :


![0b](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture%209b.PNG)

**Notice**:
- The header and footer of the page sit inside <header> and <footer> Elements
- The courses are grouped together inside a <section> element that has a class attribute whose value is courses (to
distinguish it from other <section> elements on the page
- The sidebar sits inside an <aside> element

<br>

# Quick Summary:

```
DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.

You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.

The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.

<iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.

The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.

Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

***SO*** before makeing a perfect website ever you must know many things or collect it to helps your pages to sucsess..
the important of them is:

- ## How im targeting by my site :
~~"the entire world"~~ this will be your first wrong answear t is unlikely to be relevant to everyone cuse not every one use internet will intersted with your product or service, so wehen you know how your targeting you will be ready for the next question:

- ## Why anyone will be interset in my wesite?
and to know that answear you have to discover the **underlying motivations** for why visitors come to the site and the
**specific goals** they will gain from this visit witch could be *general information* OR *traying to be familiar with the service or product that you offer* OR *looking for time sensitive information* OR ***Do they need to contact you?***

> also you have to figure What your visitors are trying to achieve by visting your website

- ## What information your visitors need to get :
you can use some **Key Information** hers some:
1. Will visitors be familiar with your subject area / brand or do you need to introduce yourself?

2. Will they be familiar with the product / service / information you are covering or do they need background information on it?

3. What are the most important features of what you are offering?

4. What is special about what you offer that differentiates you from other sites that offer something similar?

5. Once people have achieved the goal that sent them to your site, are there common questions people ask about this subject area?
<br>
<br>

- ## How Often People Will Visit Your Site :
it depends on :
- how often you will update your site or some parts of it and also depends on:
1. How often people will return to purchase from you
2. is your stock updated or your service changed

When you know what needs be on your site, you can start to organize the information which called **Site Map**
which help you to see how those pages can be grouped togather, and will inform users how to navigate in the site, it usually begin with the homepage
to make it simple to you this pic will show you simply how the map looks like: 
<br>


![sitemap](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture1.PNG) 


- ## Always start with sketchs :
**sketchs** helps you to ensure that all of the information that you need to be on a page is included,no need to include the colors or fonts styles or backgrounds or images, It should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page,
**sketchs** helps you to give a small picture to your client about what the weeb design will look like

### Where you can **sketchs** ?
***NO*** need for any compliments it all what you can use is 

![skitch](https://3madov-77.github.io/reading-notes/Resorses/Capture01a-2.PNG)

There are also online sketchs tools that can helps you like:
[gomockingbird](http://gomockingbird.com) OR [lovelycharts](http://lovelycharts.com)

Example how sketches looks : 


![skitch](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/home.png)

<br>
<br>

- ## Always try to include your message across design :
witch is smart primary gool, also with so much on the page the designer needs to **organize** and **prioritize** the information to communicate their message witch basicly help users to find what they want,
<br>
<br>

> try to create a **visual hierarchy** witch let users focus on the messages that you want, then guide them to subsequent messages, by depend on **size** **color** **style** and even ***Images***.. witch creat high visual contrast attract the
eye first and sometimes **the right image can succinctly reveal more than an entire page of text**,
<br>

> Most web users do not read entire pages,they skim to find information

<br>
<br> 
<br>

- ## Always try to **Similarity** and **groubing** :
there is alot of teqnique ill mention them here :

1. Proximity:
When several items are placed close together, they are perceived as more related than items that are placed further apart

2. Closure:
When faced with a complicated arrangement of items, we will often look for a single or recognisable pattern or form.
A real or imaginary box can be formed around elements due to their proximity and alignment

3. Continuance:
When elements are placed in a line or a curve then they are perceived to be more related than those that are not following the same direction.
This can be used to direct a reader from one part of a page to the next

4. White Space:
Placing related items closer together and leaving a bigger gap between unrelated items

5. color:
A background color placed behind related items to emphasize their connection

6. Borders:
A line can be drawn around the border of the group or between it and its neighbors

<br> 
<br>

- ## Choose navigation design wisely :
witch i like to call it **The Concise Ways**, wich must be quick and easy to read and **descriptive**, you can make alot of navigation bars (first nav second nav....etc) but be carfule it must be maximum 8 links each bar,

 ### and remamber to make it > `Context` , `Interactive` , `Consistent`
