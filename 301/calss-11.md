# What is EJS?

What is the “E” for? “Embedded?” Could be. How about “Effective,” “Elegant,” or just “Easy”? EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It’s just plain JavaScript.

 

# Features of EJS :

Fast compilation and rendering
Simple template tags: <% %>
Both server JS and browser support
Static caching of intermediate JavaScript
Static caching of templates
Complies with the Express view system
 

## Conclusion:

EJS let's us spin up quick applications when we don't need anything too complex. By using partials and having the ability to easily pass variables to our views, we can build some great applications quickly.

 

# Tags:

<% ‘Scriptlet’ tag, for control-flow, no output
<%_ ‘Whitespace Slurping’ Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it
<%= Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
<%- Outputs the unescaped value into the template
<%# Comment tag, no execution, no output
<%% Outputs a literal ‘<%’
%> Plain ending tag
-%> Trim-mode (‘newline slurp’) tag, trims following newline
_%> ‘Whitespace Slurping’ ending tag, removes all whitespace after it
