# - Impostor syndrome:

* is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments or talents and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud", Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they have achieved. Individuals with impostorism incorrectly attribute their success to luck, or interpret it as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent than they perceive themselves to be, While early research focused on the prevalence among high-achieving women, impostor syndrome has been recognized to affect both men and women equally..

* a phenomenon (an experience) that occurs in an individual, not a mental disorder.
Impostor phenomenon is not recognized in the DSM or ICD, although both of these classification systems recognize low self-esteem and sense of failure as associated symptoms of depression..
